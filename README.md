# mab-dom

<!-- [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/mab-dom)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mab-dom) -->

A very minimal DOM library intended to replace a small subset of jQuery convenience methods.

## Rationale

If you're looking to port a complex jQuery-based app to vanilla JS, this library definitely _isn't_ what you're looking for! 

It was built solely for use in my own personal utility app suite, and as such:

- Doesn't implement huge chunks of jQuery's functionality at all
- Pays _no_ attention whatsoever to compatibility with older browsers
- Has no automated test suite
- Comes with zero guarantees
